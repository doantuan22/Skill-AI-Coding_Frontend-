# Design archetypes

Twelve curated visual families. Each describes **intent and DNA**, not a look to reproduce. Values are relative (`low`/`medium`/`high`) so they adapt to any token system. Adapt, combine within [compatibility](#compatibility), and override any trait when product evidence disagrees.

Field meanings: *perception* = what the audience should feel in the first seconds; *CTA* = how conversion actions behave; *poor fit* = where the archetype actively harms the product.

## Compatibility

Mix at most one primary + one secondary (+ one scoped accent trait). `✓` compatible, `~` only with a scoped rule (e.g., "secondary affects hero only"), `✗` reject.

Common coherent mixes: `premium-product + technical-platform` (premium hardware/silicon, "technical minimalism"), `developer-tool + editorial-product` (docs-first developer brands), `marketplace + travel-commerce` (booking platforms), `modern-saas + data-heavy-product` (product site → app continuity), `editorial-product + luxury` (fashion journals).

Archetypes are product-level families; visual languages that realize them are in the [style catalog](../knowledge/styles/README.md) (e.g., premium-product → `style.calm-futurism`, `style.cinematic`, `style.minimal`; developer-tool → `style.developer-tool`, `style.monochrome`; editorial-product → `style.editorial`, `style.swiss`).

A mix is rejected (`INCOMPATIBLE_REFERENCE_MIX`) when the two sources disagree on **density** by two levels *in the same region*, on **motion character** (cinematic vs snappy for the same element type), or on **surface philosophy** (card-driven vs card-free) without a scoped rule.
