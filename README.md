# UI Engineering Plugin

A structured AI coding plugin for frontend engineering, design systems, and UI/UX implementation.

It drives an AI coding agent through a two-phase web UI/UX workflow — Phase 1 locks the UX structure
(actors, flows, pages, information architecture), Phase 2 realizes the visual design and frontend with
rendered evidence — backed by a Design Knowledge System, capability/technology resolvers, a Playwright
runtime runner and design-quality evals.

## Architecture

The repository holds one shared, platform-neutral plugin core (`plugins/ui-engineering`) with thin
platform adapters for different AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, MCP).

```

Detailed architecture documentation lives in `development/docs/`
(start with `architecture.md` and `plugin-architecture.md`). Installation and compatibility notes for
users are in `plugins/ui-engineering/docs/`.

## Install

Claude Code, directly from GitHub (the repository is a plugin marketplace named `ui-engineering`):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add doantuan22/Skill-AI-Coding_Frontend-
claude plugin install ui-ux-design@ui-engineering
```

Codex (from a clone): `codex plugin marketplace add ./Skill-AI-Coding_Frontend-` (reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`).
Other options — a single session with `claude --plugin-dir plugins/ui-engineering`, release archives and a standalone
MCP server — are described in [plugins/ui-engineering/docs/INSTALLATION.md](plugins/ui-engineering/docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (standard library only).
- Optional, for browser evidence and accessibility scans: Node.js with Playwright (and `@axe-core/playwright`
  or `axe-core`) installed in the **target** project. The plugin never installs them; without them the
  runtime tools report `BLOCKED`.

## Usage

```bash
# Version, tool list and a tool call through the unified CLI
python plugins/ui-engineering/scripts/uiux_cli.py version
python plugins/ui-engineering/scripts/uiux_cli.py tools
python plugins/ui-engineering/scripts/uiux_cli.py call self_test
python plugins/ui-engineering/scripts/uiux_cli.py call analyze_repository --params '{"project": "path/to/app"}'

# Shared MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC)
python plugins/ui-engineering/adapters/mcp/server.py

# Host bundles (Claude Code / Codex) and their verification
python plugins/ui-engineering/.claude-plugin/export.py --dev --source plugins/ui-engineering --out dist/dev/adapters
python plugins/ui-engineering/.codex-plugin/export.py --dev --source plugins/ui-engineering --out dist/dev/adapters
python plugins/ui-engineering/.claude-plugin/verify.py --bundle dist/dev/adapters/ui-ux-design-0.1.0-dev-claude-code.zip
```

## Development

Run the same checks as CI from the repository root:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t tests
python plugins/ui-engineering/scripts/validate_skill.py
python plugins/ui-engineering/scripts/knowledge_lib.py check
python plugins/ui-engineering/packaging/package_files.py
python plugins/ui-engineering/scripts/uiux_cli.py call run_evals
```

Validate the installable manifests with the Claude Code CLI: `claude plugin validate .` and
`claude plugin validate plugins/ui-engineering`.

Build and verify a package (outputs go to the git-ignored `dist/`):

```bash
python plugins/ui-engineering/packaging/build.py --dev --verify   # developer build of the working tree
python plugins/ui-engineering/packaging/build.py --verify         # release build (clean commit required)
```

`VERSION` (mirrored in `plugins/ui-engineering/VERSION`) is the single version source; see
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for changes and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution rules.
