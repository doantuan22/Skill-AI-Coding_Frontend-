# Motion & Interaction Engine

Motion must communicate, orient, or support storytelling. This module decides **motion character, intensity budget, timing/easing, vocabulary, reduced-motion behavior, and implementation strategy**, then reviews the result. It owns temporal behavior; it does not own static composition (Web Patterns) or tokens (Design System).

## Position

Runs after Visual Grammar and before Web Pattern selection is finalized (pattern choice and motion budget are checked together), then feeds Component Specs. Output goes to [MOTION-SYSTEM.md](../../templates/MOTION-SYSTEM.md) for landing/marketing/storytelling or any medium/high budget work; for low-budget app work, a `motion_character` block in `VISUAL-GRAMMAR.md` is enough. Duration/easing **values** live in `DESIGN-TOKENS.md`; MOTION-SYSTEM references token names.

Progressive disclosure: dashboards/forms load principles + M1 (+ M2 for overlays, M3 for list/detail) + reduced-motion only. M4 is for marketing/content pages; M5 only when the Capability Resolver allows it. Every entry is a structured catalog item of the [Design Knowledge System](../knowledge/README.md).

## Dependencies

- Prefer CSS transitions/transforms/keyframes, `IntersectionObserver`, `requestAnimationFrame` when justified, and native scroll-driven animation or View Transitions as progressive enhancement.
- **Reuse** an animation library already present in the project (GSAP, Framer Motion/Motion, Anime.js, etc.) instead of adding another or mixing systems.
- Do **not** add GSAP, Framer Motion, Anime.js, Three.js, Lottie or similar unless the need cannot be met natively *and* the task authorizes a new dependency. Record the justification.
