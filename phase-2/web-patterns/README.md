# Web Pattern Library

A curated composition vocabulary for realizing locked content. Patterns are **options chosen by reasoning**, never defaults. Selection happens in the [Pattern Selection Engine](../design-inspiration/pattern-selection.md); this library describes each option's requirements and failure modes.

Boundary: Phase 1 (`PAGE-SPEC`, `WIREFRAME-SPEC`) owns which blocks exist and their responsibility. Patterns decide composition, pacing and interaction presentation within that. A pattern that needs new content or changes meaning triggers a Phase 1 rollback request.

## Progressive disclosure

| Task | Load | Do not load |
|---|---|---|
| Landing / marketing / product showcase | composition, hero, sections, storytelling, conversion, motion-composition | content (unless reading-heavy) |
| Editorial / docs / blog | composition, content, navigation | hero (except editorial-split), storytelling |
| Marketplace / travel | composition, content (listing), navigation, interaction (gallery/filters), conversion | cinematic hero, sticky storytelling |
| Dashboard / app | content (high-density product) only if layout changes | hero, sections, storytelling, motion-composition |
| Small form / component | none | everything here |

## Library rules

- Each pattern lists content requirements; unmet requirements make it ineligible (`PATTERN_MISUSE`).
- Adjacent sections vary pattern or density only for a narrative reason; uniform repetition of interchangeable blocks is `GENERIC_TEMPLATE_COMPOSITION`.
- Floating pill navigation, bento grids, and three-card rows are allowed only with a recorded reason; none is a default.
- Keep this library small. Add a pattern only when a real project needs one that no existing entry covers.
