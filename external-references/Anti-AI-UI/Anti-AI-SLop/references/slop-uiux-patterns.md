# Anti-AI-Slop UI/UX — Exhaustive Pattern Catalog

Companion to `../SKILL.md`. Format for every entry: **TELL → WHY-SLOP → FIX → SEVERITY**.
Synthesized from deep research across slop-detect.com, Adrian Krebs' Show HN study
(1,590 sites scored), Thomas Wiegold, Noqta, The Fountain Institute, NNG, Refactoring
UI, WIRED, Built In, and arXiv:2603.13036 (design homogenization in vibe coding).

Severity: **P0** = single-handedly screams AI / a11y failure · **HIGH** = strong tell ·
**MEDIUM** = trained eyes notice · **LOW** = subtle, cumulative.

## 0. THE ROOT CAUSE & THE GESTALT

LLMs generate UI by computing a weighted average across their training distribution
(Tailwind docs + shadcn/ui + abandoned-default repos + 2020–2024 Dribbble SaaS shots).
Output **collapses toward the visual mean**. Every unspecified decision is filled with
the single most probable token. This is structural math, not a bug.

**The full gestalt formula — any 5+ = unmistakable AI slop:**
```
purple-gradient + Inter + 3-card grid + centered hero + rounded-2xl + pill CTA
+ "trusted by X teams" + "unlock/supercharge" copy + gradient blob background
+ shadcn dashboard grid + generic Lucide icons + letter-in-rounded-box logo
```

**The cure (one rule to rule them all):** every spacing value, color, font, grid,
and animation must be *chosen for a content-specific reason*. If you can't explain
WHY, it's slop.

## 1. HERO / ABOVE-THE-FOLD

| # | Tell | Why-slop | Fix | Severity |
|---|------|----------|-----|----------|
| H1 | Centered headline + subhead + symmetric dual CTA (filled primary + ghost secondary) | Statistically safest layout in training data; every 2020–2023 SaaS template | Left-align text; asymmetric split (text left / real product shot right); ONE dominant CTA + text-link secondary | HIGH |
| H2 | Gradient `bg-clip-text` headline (purple→pink/blue) | #1 most-cited visual AI tell; the visual "delve"; fails contrast on partial stops | Solid high-contrast headline; emphasis via weight/size/typeface | P0 |
| H3 | Eyebrow pill badge above H1 (`✨ Now with AI`, `🚀 New`) | slop-detect scores +5; decoration cosplaying as information | Remove unless genuinely time-bound; if kept, plain text, no emoji, no pill | HIGH |
| H4 | Aurora/gradient blobs (`blur-3xl` purple/blue circles) behind hero | "Radial light bloom for no particular reason"; saturates 2020–22 Dribbble data | Solid bg, subtle noise/grain, or single-tone radial ≤5% opacity | HIGH |
| H5 | Perspective-tilted dashboard mockup + glow (`rotateY(-5deg) shadow-2xl`) | Canonical "AI product shot"; nobody screenshotted real software | Flat, straight-on real product screenshot; minimal flat device frame | MEDIUM |
| H6 | Greyed fake "Trusted by 5,000+ teams" logo strip | Logos often hallucinated/unlicensed; domain registered 3 weeks ago | Only verified customer logos w/ permission; else omit; use named case studies | HIGH |
| H7 | `h-screen` hero with only text + button | PowerPoint-slide emptiness; pushes content below fold | `py-24 sm:py-32 lg:py-40`; full-height only with rich visual filling ≥60% | LOW |
| H8 | Standard skeleton hero→features→pricing→FAQ→CTA→footer | "Default WordPress theme" structure; most-probable page order | Introduce ≥1 unconventional section; break the template rhythm | MEDIUM |

## 2. COLOR & GRADIENT

| # | Tell | Why-slop | Fix | Severity |
|---|------|----------|-----|----------|
| C1 | `indigo-500`/`violet-500`/`purple-500` (`#6366f1 #8b5cf6 #a855f7`) as primary accent | Tailwind's 5-yr default button color; >50% of YC Spring'25 AI cos used it | ONE brand hue that is NOT purple/indigo; define via CSS var / config | P0 |
| C2 | `from-purple-500 to-pink-500` / `from-indigo-500 to-purple-600` / `from-blue-500 to-cyan-500` | Exact gradient combos dominating 2020–22 tutorials; "safest choice AI can make" | Single-hue gradient (brand-500→700) max, or flat color; gradient must draw the eye to ONE focal point | P0 |
| C3 | Gradient on text AND button AND border AND background at once | Each fine alone; all together = converged fingerprint | Budget ONE gradient element per section | HIGH |
| C4 | Neon glow `box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(purple)` on cards/buttons/text | SaaS WordArt; when everything glows nothing is emphasized | Shadows = elevation only; neutral `shadow-sm/md`; glow only on focus ring | MEDIUM |
| C5 | Aurora blobs / mesh gradient washes (`blur(100px)` saturated circles) | Named slop-detect pattern; every vibe-coder default for "modern" bg | Noise texture / single-tone radial ≤10%; never animate (paint storms) | MEDIUM |
| C6 | `bg-gradient-to-br from-X to-Y` on every surface | Most common gradient direction in tutorials; kills hierarchy | Flat solids for 90% of surfaces; `to-b` if any; ONE gradient bg per page | MEDIUM |
| C7 | Low-contrast `text-gray-400`/`slate-400` body on white/dark | 83.9% of homepages fail WCAG contrast (WebAIM 2026); "elegant to you, invisible to millions" | Body ≥ `gray-700` (light) / `gray-200` (dark); verify 4.5:1 | P0 (a11y) |
| C8 | "Just slate-900 + indigo accent" default dark mode | Every Tailwind dark-mode tutorial; zero brand intent | Warmer dark surface (`zinc-900`); brand-matched accent; 2–3 surface elevations | HIGH |
| C9 | Oversaturated "vibrant" palette (every accent at -500) | AI stacks every high-performing color at once; busy & artificial | 60-30-10; desaturate to -700/-800 text, -50/-100 bg; max 2 saturated/viewport | MEDIUM |
| C10 | No brand color system (random hex, interchangeable identity) | "Nobody made a decision here"; meta-tell enabling all other color slop | Define 1 primary + ramp, 1–2 accents, 8–10 greys, semantic colors; tokens in config | HIGH |

## 3. TYPOGRAPHY

| # | Tell | Why-slop | Fix | Severity |
|---|------|----------|-----|----------|
| T1 | Inter/Geist for display AND body, no second face | Default in Figma/Tailwind/v0/shadcn; "safety creates invisibility" | Distinctive display ≠ Inter (Fraunces, Bricolage Grotesque, Satoshi, Cabinet Grotesk); Inter OK for body only if paired | HIGH |
| T2 | Gradient `bg-clip-text text-transparent` headline | Every v0/Lovable/Bolt output; +6 on slop-detect | Solid color, high contrast | P0 |
| T3 | `text-5xl font-extrabold tracking-tighter` on every heading | "Crushed display tracking"; max-impact formula = sameness | Modular scale (1.25); bold(700) max weight; `tracking-tight` not tighter | HIGH |
| T4 | Flat/arbitrary type scale (8–12 random sizes, or H1≈H2) | No ratio, no rhythm; hierarchy breaks | Modular scale, 4–6 sizes: 12/14/16/20/25/31/39 | HIGH |
| T5 | 5–6 font weights on one page | Each component generated in isolation; eye can't anchor | Max 3 weights (400/500/700); never Light body | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| T6 | Centered multi-line body paragraphs | "Safe" symmetry; ragged left edge kills readability (WebAIM) | Body always `text-left`; center only single-line headings/taglines | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| T7 | Uniform `leading` on everything (1.5 on headings too) | One value applied universally; no proportional adjustment | Headings `leading-tight` (1.25); body `leading-relaxed` (1.625) | MEDIUM |
| T8 | Full-width body text (80–120 chars/line) | AI ignores measure; tracking fails >75 chars | `max-w-prose` (65ch) on every text block | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| T9 | `tracking-widest uppercase text-xs` eyebrow above every section | When every section has one, none stand out; auto-applied everywhere | 1–2 per page; `tracking-wide` max; `text-muted-foreground` | MEDIUM |
| T10 | Emoji as heading/section icons (`🚀 Features`) | Renders per-OS; zero semantics; demo-quality | SVG icons (Lucide/Heroicons/Phosphor), `currentColor`, fixed viewBox | HIGH |
| T11 | Playfair Display + Inter "tasteslop" pairing | WIRED-coined; most-suggested serif; "premium mediocre" new default | Non-Playfair serif (Fraunces/Instrument Serif/Newsreader); shared x-height | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| T12 | Positive `tracking-wide` on body copy | "Wide body tracking" slop-detect tell; loses word-shape | `tracking-normal`/`tight` on body; wide only on <14px caps labels | MEDIUM |
| T13 | Monospace for non-code "tech vibes" | Decoration; reduces prose readability | Mono ONLY for `<code>/<pre>/<kbd>` | MEDIUM |
| T14 | Inconsistent type across components (nav Inter, hero Poppins…) | Token drift; "isolated statistical events" | Define typography once in config; max 2 families site-wide | MEDIUM-HIGH |

> **Type slop fingerprint (slop-detect):** Geist/Inter default + crushed display tracking + wide body tracking + flat hierarchy = "Heavy" on type axis alone.

## 5. LAYOUT & SPACING

| # | Tell | Why-slop | Fix | Severity |
|---|------|----------|-----|----------|
| L1 | Uniform `py-20` on every section | Metronomic rhythm; no semantic weight | Vary: hero `py-40` → features `py-16` → CTA `pt-12 pb-16`; no two adjacent equal | HIGH |
| L2 | Everything in `max-w-7xl mx-auto` | Single centered column; "average of all design ever fed in" | Vary by content: text `max-w-3xl`, grids `max-w-6xl`, ≥1 full-bleed/page | HIGH |

## 11. SLOP-DETECT SCORING AXES (quick self-scan)
slop-detect.com scores 27 deterministic patterns across 4 axes. Trigger several → "Heavy":
- **Fonts:** Geist/Inter default · crushed display tracking · wide body tracking · flat hierarchy
- **Gradients:** gradient hero text · aurora blobs · colored glows · gradient-heavy bg
- **Layout:** centered dual-CTA hero · 3-card grid · eyebrow pill · uniform radius · glassmorphism
- **Copy:** hype verbs · "for modern teams" · invented metrics · generic CTA

Adrian Krebs scored 1,590 Show HN sites: **22% showed "Heavy" AI tells.** Most reliable
single signals he found: colored left-borders, gradient text, indigo accent, eyebrow pill.

## Creative Freedom

These patterns and rules are **bare minimum guidelines**. You are encouraged to:

- **Improvise beyond what's documented** — use your own creativity and judgment
- **Experiment with novel solutions** — don't feel constrained to only what's listed here
- **Adapt to context** — every project has unique requirements that may warrant different approaches
- **Invent new patterns** — if you discover a better solution, use it

Treat this reference as a **foundation, not a ceiling**. The goal is to avoid AI slop while still producing innovative, intentional design — not to limit you to a fixed set of "approved" solutions.
